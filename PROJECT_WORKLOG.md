### Date: 2026-09-08
- **What Client Asked / Problem**:
  1. Asked whether the two new HTML-based games ("Yummy Bingo" and "Teen Patti") are currently commented out in the app.
  2. Asked to maintain a dedicated markdown log file that documents all client requests and team work day-by-day in simple, plain English.
- **What We Did**:
  1. Checked the codebase and confirmed that both "Yummy Bingo" and "Teen Patti" are temporarily commented out inside the room games selection sheet (`games_panel.dart`) while they are being optimized.
  2. Created `PROJECT_WORKLOG.md` in the project root and added an agent rule in `.agents/AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/daily-worklog-enforcement.md` to ensure the AI updates this log on every task.

### Date: 2026-09-07
- **What Client Asked / Problem**:
  "The bottom sheet closing or anything in the spin game is causing me to be thrown out of the game back to the room. Check it and resolve it."
- **What We Did**:
  - **Found the bug**: When the win/loss result sheet finished displaying, two separate timers tried to close it at almost the exact same time. The first timer closed the sheet, but because the sheet was already closing, the second timer accidentally closed the entire game screen instead, throwing the user back to the voice room.
  - **Fixed the bug**:
    1. Added a strict check so a timer only closes the sheet if the sheet is actually open and hasn't already closed.
    2. Added a safety guard (`PopScope`) on the game screen so that even if a close action is triggered, it will only ever close the popup sheet and will **never** throw the user out of the game screen.
- **Files Touched**:
  - `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/spin_wheel_screen.dart`
- **Status**: Completed & Verified on physical device (Vivo V2132)

### Date: 2026-09-06
- **What Client Asked / Problem**:
  1. "There is an error in the game still: betting is going for the current round, but the previous round's result is showing in the bottom sheet. The round sync is not correct. Find out the reason and resolve it fast."
  2. "Both new games are lagging in release mode. Suggest a solution to make them zero error and smooth while keeping UI/UX premium."
- **What We Did**:
  1. **Fixed Round Synchronization in Spin Wheel**:
     - Synchronized the app's clock with the server's master clock down to the exact millisecond using Firebase RTDB `.info/serverTimeOffset`.
     - Strictly enforced the 40-second server round cycle: 0s–20s (Betting Open), 20s–30s (Betting Locked), 30s–35s (Wheel Spinning), 35s–38s (Celebration Popup), 38s–40s (Next Round Preparation).
     - Added a guard that immediately blocks any old or previous round results from ever popping up during a new betting round.
  2. **Analyzed HTML Games (Teen Patti & Yummy Bingo)**:
     - Identified that running raw HTML games in default mobile WebViews causes lag and resource errors (`about:blank` vs localhost).
     - Temporarily kept them hidden in the games panel so players only access the fully optimized native Flutter games (Spin Wheel & Lucky Draw) while the HTML games are optimized.
- **Files Touched**:
  - `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/spin_wheel_screen.dart`
  - `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/teen_patti_screen.dart`
  - `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/yummy_bingo_screen.dart`
  - `functions/index.js`
- **Status**: Completed

### Date: 2026-09-05
- **What Client Asked / Problem**:
  Make sure real backend calculations and atomic database transactions work correctly for gifts, rocket events, diamonds, and beans without race conditions or balance discrepancies.
- **What We Did**:
  - Audited and enforced Firestore transactions in Firebase Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`).
  - Ensured all coin/diamond deductions and prize credits happen on the server only, preventing client-side manipulation or double-spending under high concurrency.
- **Files Touched**:
  - `functions/index.js`
  - `.agents/skills/firebase-transactions-security/SKILL.md`
- **Status**: Completed
